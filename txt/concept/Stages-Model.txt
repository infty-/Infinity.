Stages are selections that can be bound to one or more different locations in documents or be just floating.

You can apply transitions to stages in order to create new stages.

Removing stages can be seen as TAGGING them as "no longer accessible".
	 - Should a tag be able to step in the timeline that much? Yes, because it can be seen as request for action to the processor.
